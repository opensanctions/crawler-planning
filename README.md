Welcome to the OpenSanctions Crawler team!

# Getting started

We will assign your first task on the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/opensanctions/projects/2) which we'll pick to be a nice introductory task.

Your next step, is to dive into the [instructions to get started with zavod](https://zavod.opensanctions.org/), our ETL framework, and see if you can get a crawler working.

# Workflow

The **Backlog column** is ordered in decreasing priority.

When you're ready to start your next task, take the next top card and move it to the **In Progress column**. Add yourself as an assignee, if we haven't already done so.

When you feel your new/modified crawler is ready for production, 
  - create a pull request with your branch
  - link your pull request to the card issue
  - move the card to the **In Review column**.

If it's ready, we'll merge it, move it to the **Done column**, it will be deployed automatically, and run according to its schedule.

If some changes are needed, we'll comment on the pull request, and move it back to to the **In Progress column** for you to revise.
