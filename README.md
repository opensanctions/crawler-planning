Welcome to the OpenSanctions Crawler team!

# Getting started

We will assign your first task on the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/opensanctions/projects/2) which we'll pick to be a nice introductory task.

Your next step, is to dive into the [instructions to get started with zavod](https://zavod.opensanctions.org/), our ETL framework, and see if you can get a crawler working.
